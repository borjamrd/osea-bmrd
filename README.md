# OSEA - Borja Mu√±oz

Hello, here you can play, add or just manage your favourite songs.

## Run fake backend
In order to retrieve song's data, you must `npm run server` and check `http://localhost:3000/`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via Jest
Run `test:coveraget` to execute the unit tests via Jest and see code test's coverage
